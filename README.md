# PortScanner
This Python script is a simple and efficient port scanner designed for network diagnostics and security testing. It allows users to input a domain or IP address and scans all 65,535 ports to identify which ones are open, mapping them to common services like HTTP, SSH, or DNS using a predefined dictionary. The results, including open ports, their associated services, and the total scan duration, are logged to a timestamped file for easy reference. With built-in error handling, real-time feedback, and a focus on usability, this tool provides a straightforward way to assess network accessibility and potential vulnerabilities.
